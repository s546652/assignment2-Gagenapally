###### A&G Restaurant

Located in downtown Maryville, 
A&G Restaurant is proud to be **family-owned** since 1975.
A place to gather and embelish, A&G Restaurant was established by **George Groumoutis** over 40 years ago. A Greek immigrant, George and his brother, Tony, opened the first A&G Restaurant two years prior to George paving his path to Maryville.
